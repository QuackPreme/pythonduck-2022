### QUACK PREME ###
We are QuackPreme. We are an fll team for the grades of 7th - 9th.
We exist for a few years in the herzog middle school
in Tzoran israel.

### Quack Dastly ###
We named our robot "Quack Dastly" after the singer of the song
"Nevr gonna give you up" by Rick Astley.
Quack can switch add ons and stuff like that in secods with a special mechanism that our mechanics team built.

### About the missions ###
We have 5 runs each run is named after a color we have the yellow, cyan, red, white & blue.
Each of these does a different thing in a different part of the board.
You can look at what each does in the top of the files.

### About the main file ###
The main file is a file we created to make our executers lifes a lot easier and save a whole bunch of time by doing the following:
instead of making the runners find the execution file from the file manager inside the ev3 we made it that they only need to click one button and it will run the file without the need o search for it.
the main file is saving us 30s from the 2:30 mins in the game.
